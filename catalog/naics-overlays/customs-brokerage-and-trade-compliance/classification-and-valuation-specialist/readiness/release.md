## Readiness Decision

- Decision: Approved for validated spec-pack release.
- Reviewer: commons-keeper
- Date: 2026-04-09
- Notes:
  - The lane is limited to customs review support for classification and valuation evidence, findings, and follow-up.
  - Final legal interpretation, binding ruling authority, and fraud adjudication remain outside the lane.
  - Missing records, authority conflicts, and signoff requests remain hard escalation or refusal conditions.
